            <h2><img src="frankieportrait.jpg" alt="Frankie Portrait" width="359">Hi, I'm
             Frankie!</h2>
            <p> This
            is just a fun introduction about who I am, some fun facts about me and my most
             popular works. Then I can go a little into my reasons for writing, probably 
            some things about how I love coming up wiht my own little worlds when I was 
            a kid and writing wtories for fun, with some little jokes about annoying 
            siblings that most children will relate to and even a very specific reference 
            to having fun with something that isn't really a thing anymore that parents who 
            grew up in my generation will relate to. Pixel Chix was so sassy! <br><br> I 
            can throw in something about how I got the idea for my first book, like maybe it's 
            been something I've had in my head for practically my entire life and I finally 
            got the push to share it in book form, or may the idea just struck me out of 
            nowhere and I knew I just had to make that book. I might have had difficulties 
            finding someone who would publish me until I finally found the right people who 
            were willing to give me a chance, and next thing you know, my mom is calling me 
            to tell me kids are reading my book in the kindergarten she teaches!<br><br>
            Then I conclude by talking about how nowadays I spend my time working on my ideas 
            at home with my delightful spouse and our cats who each have names that were 
            popular in the 30s and 40s, like Dorothy and Nelson. I take a moment to express my 
            gratitude for the privelege of getting to make a career out of doing something I 
            love and how excited I am to keep pumping out titles that technically count as 
            chapter books so that fourth graders can continue to have a fun but relatively easy 
            read they can lean on for filling out their daily reading logs.</p>
